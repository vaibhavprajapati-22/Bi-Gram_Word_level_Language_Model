# Bi-Gram Word level Language Model
This repository contains the code for a Bi-Gram Word Level Language Model. The model is designed to predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous word, utilizing a bi-gram approach.

### Overview
The language model is implemented in Python and can be run using Google Colab. It leverages the power of bi-gram analysis to understand the probabilistic relationships between consecutive words in a given text.

## How to run
1. Save the pride_and_prejudice.txt and BiGram_Word_level_Language_Model file on your local computer or upload the files in Google colab.(I would prefer to upload it in google colab to get GPU acceleration)
2. Run the notebook cells by cell
   Note : Cell containing the below lines need to be run only once
          import nltk
          nltk.download('punkt')
3. On the last cell sampling code is written which generatees 5 sentences
